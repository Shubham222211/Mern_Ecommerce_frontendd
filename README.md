Frontend Overview
I have developed a user-friendly frontend for the e-commerce platform using React. It connects seamlessly with the backend and provides a smooth and interactive experience. Here's what it includes:

Key Features
Login and Registration:

Login: Users can log in using their email and password. The app verifies their credentials with the backend and logs them in securely.
Registration: New users can sign up by entering details like name, email, and password. Their data is saved securely.
Home Page:

The homepage displays all the available products fetched from the backend.
Users can browse through the catalog and explore the products.
Search Functionality:

A search bar is available to help users find specific products by name.
The app filters and shows only the products matching the search term.
Add to Cart:

Users can add products to their cart with a single click.
The cart is saved in real-time, linked to the user’s account.
Sort Products:

Users can sort the product list based on criteria like price, popularity, or category.
This helps them find products easily.
How It Works
React Router:
I used React Router to create multiple pages, such as login, register, and home, without reloading the page.
Navigation is smooth and fast.

Dynamic Interactions:
All the functionalities like search, sort, and add-to-cart are handled dynamically using React. The app fetches data from the backend in real-time and updates the UI immediately.

Seamless Backend Integration:
The frontend communicates with the backend using API requests to handle features like login, register, fetching products, and managing the cart.

Why It’s Great for Users
Simple Navigation: Easy-to-use navigation ensures a hassle-free experience.
Fast and Responsive: Instant updates and smooth transitions make the app fast.
Secure Login: User data and actions are secured with backend authentication.
